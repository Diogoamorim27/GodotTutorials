# Branching Dialog System

Hey Guys! In this tutorial I'll teach how to implement a branching dialog system on Godot 3.1 with a dynamic GUI, meaning it responds accordingly to the number of dialogue options presented.

The way we go about it is by using the [Dialog Graph Plugin](https://github.com/ejnij/Godot-DialogGraphPlugin/) made by the user [ejnij](https://github.com/ejnij). To download the plugin form **inside** godot you must:

    * Go to AssetLib
    * Search for **Dialog Graph Plugin**
